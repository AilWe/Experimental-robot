# Experimental-robot
It is time to change the world.
If you search me, you may have a similar idea about Experimental robots. I have been working on biological and photonics for really long time. I know how frustrated when you cannot repeat other people's paper. I know how long it takes to align a single light path. It is time to change, these robots can replace people to save money and time for companies and for university. More importantly, it gives out freedom to all experimental researchers. 
If it can form a supply chain, every lab can have a experimental robots same price as an iPhone.
We are young and passion, and maybe we can change the world.
